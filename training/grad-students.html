    The lab has a general focus on the development and treatment of anxiety and stress-related disorders. Therefore, the most successful applicants to the lab typically have broader interests in both exposure therapy across anxiety related disorders, and in the development and treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (see research areas and recent papers for more information). Students are involved in multiple projects during their time in the lab, and so students with some flexibility in research focus within both these areas tend to be more satisfied with their experience. UNR follows a clinical science model so training includes a heavy focus on clinical research, alongside rigorous training in evidence-based psychotherapies.

    UNR’s clinical training program provides students with in-house clinical training prior to externships. Working with faculty in both a clinical training and research capacity fosters a model in which research and practice inform one another. Most of Dr. Lancaster’s students also receive in-house clinical training from her in CBT for anxiety and related disorders (including PTSD and OCD).
