    Our undergraduate and post-baccalaureate team of research assistants is essential to the success of the lab. Due to the training involved, we require a commitment of 10 hours per week for at least two semesters. Research assistants sometimes choose to register for course credit (PSY 275 or 375) but are not required to do so. (For information regarding whether you should register for these courses to fulfill degree requirements, please consult your academic advisor.) Those interested in becoming RAs in the lab should email the lab director with their <a href="#">application</a> and a direct request to find out whether there are currently any openings. Those with strong applications will be invited to complete an interview. Successful applicants typically demonstrate a genuine interest in gaining experience with clinical science and anxiety research, rather than just a desire to fulfill a course requirement alone. We often have more requests than we can accommodate, so students are encouraged to reach out early. When possible, we recommend reaching out around March/April for involvement starting in the fall, and around Oct/Nov for involvement starting in the spring.

    The specific experiences research assistants (RAs) have during their time in the lab will depend on the nature and stage of the projects with which they are involved. Experiences have previously included: literature review and synthesis, data cleaning, and data analysis. RAs have also assisted in the collection of behavioral, physiological, and subjective (self-report) data. Although not required, several RAs have expressed interest in developing independent projects, and have completed poster presentations at local or regional conferences. Advanced RAs interested in pursuing a HURA (honors thesis) or NURA (non-honors capstone) projects in the lab are encouraged to reach out to Dr. Lancaster directly.
