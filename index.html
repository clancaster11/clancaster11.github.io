However, our understanding of its mechanisms is still rapidly evolving. Our research evaluates the mechanisms of exposure therapy and tests strategies for enhancing its efficacy. A primary aim is to translate lessons learned from basic science and behavioral neuroscience to clinical application."

About 8% of the US population will experience PTSD at some point in their lifetime. Our research investigates factors that protect against the development of PTSD and other stress-related disorders with the ultimate aim of informing the prevention and treatment of PTSD. We focus in particular on populations with high levels of occupational stress, including military personnel, first responders, and healthcare providers."

A developing aim of our research is to study the influence of social factors on the onset and treatment of anxiety and stress-related disorders. Ongoing work evaluates the impact of in-group/out-group racial status on reactions to trauma disclosure and the experience of social anxiety; social allocation of threat vigilance and reactivity in PTSD; and the influence of social factors on outcomes from exposure therapy."
