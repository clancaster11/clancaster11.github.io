Mary is a second year doctoral student in the clinical psychology program at UNR. She graduated from UC Irvine with a B.A. in Psychology and Social Behavior, where she did an honors project focusing on how positive emotion impacts moral decision-making. After college, she joined Dr. Aoife O'Donovan's THRIVE lab as a lab manager and study coordinator and worked on projects related to PTSD and the immune system. Now she is excited to be a graduate student at the Center for Fearless Research to examine mechanisms of anxiety disorders and PTSD and how to utilize these mechanisms to help guide treatment. Currently, she is interested in leveraging social support and gratitude to help individuals with PTSD. In her free time, she enjoys lifting weights, climbing walls, traveling, hiking, and reading (for fun).
